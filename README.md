ðŸ§  Overview
Every year, 20â€“40% of global crop yields are lost due to plant diseases, posing serious challenges to food security and sustainability. Traditional disease detection methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often inaccessible to small-scale farmers.

To address this, I built an AI-powered plant leaf disease detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system classifies diseases from leaf images with high accuracy and provides real-time diagnosis through an intuitive user interface.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
âœ… CNN-based deep learning model for image classification

âœ… Trained on a dataset with 38 distinct plant disease classes

âœ… Achieved 95%+ test accuracy

âœ… Streamlit-powered UI for easy and real-time disease detection

âœ… Reduces manual inspection costs and time

âœ… Empowers precision farming through early detection and action
